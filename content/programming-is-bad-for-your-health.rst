I've just been reading this article on `why sitting still is bad for
you <http://health.stackexchange.com/questions/124/why-is-sitting-for-long-periods-unhealthy>`__
and, if I read it right, standing still is not much better .
It is hardly news. We were designed to be active. But it is always
uncomfortable to have the abstract awareness of harm condensed to actual
damage vectors.
I've tried for years to get going the Pomodoro principle - but my
concentration span doesn't seem to like the short 25 minute periodicity.
Time to make more effort perhaps.
