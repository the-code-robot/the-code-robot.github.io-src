As someone who has put together quite a few business plans over the
years, `this short (4 minute) video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3zKgAetG5k>`_ from Prof Sam Savage struck me as
quite insightful.
For me it highlights the difference between those of us with a
knowledge of the theory of probability and those who have really thought
about the way probability matters manifest in daily life. (I'm somewhere
in between, and probably (hmm interesting word choice) closer to the
theoretical end).
I notice that in the background, Prof Savage has a copy of Bernstein's
"Against the Gods" which I am pleased also to own and to have read,
although in any discussion on probability, it would be a crime not to
mention "Fooled By Randomness" from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
And now that I'm thinking of statistical solecisms, the common theme
between Savage, Bernstein and Taleb, I'm reminded of the joke about the
goverment education minister who was often heard to complain of the
large number of schools which were still below average.
Enjoy the video.
