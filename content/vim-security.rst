I've just read https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/11/editor-malware.html and https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/why-i-switched-from-vundle-to-plug/ which both discuss some issues about text editor security.

TL,DR:

1. vim-plug is preferred to vundle
2. developers may be seen as high value targets for system compromise.
3. beware git:// protocol
