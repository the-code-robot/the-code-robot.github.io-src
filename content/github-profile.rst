Because a number of third party services seem to believe that you
cannot possibly be a serious programmer unless you have an account on
GitHub, I have had to create one.
But my shiny new `GitHub profile <https://github.com/coderobot-gh>`__
is only a cypher to direct anyone who passes by to my public
repositories `on Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/coderobot>`__ .
