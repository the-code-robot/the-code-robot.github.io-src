I found the `Reactive Manifesto <http://reactivemanifesto.org>`_ while researching executable specifications.

The key concepts:

* Responsive (ie fast handling of user input)
* Resilient (ie keep going in face of failure)
* Message based (everywhere)
* Elastc (responsive under varying workload - and predictively reactive rather than after the fact).

The find came from `this paper <http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1342/01-CRE.pdf>`_ on executable business processes which was interesting to me because it referred to BPMN.
