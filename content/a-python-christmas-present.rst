| Nose is my current Python testing framework of choice.

| When I'm doing TDD which is more or less all the time\*, I'm capturing

logs and (shock horror) print statements and I commonly invoke nosetests
in a very noisy way with the -sv switches.
| A few days ago, I found myself thinking about writing an output

colourizer for nose when (gasp) it occurred to me that one might already
exists. And, wonder of wonders, I was right.
| I would like to introduce you to

`rednose <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rednose>`__. It's nearly
Christmas, the plugin (appropriately) is called 'rednose' and it
represents the gift of visually interesting test results.
| Rednose is easy to install, easy to invoke, and it works like a dream.

I was especially pleased with it's ability to colourize logs and stack
traces.
| Kudos to the developer https://github.com/timbertson.

| \* If I'm not doing TDD I'm researching an unfamiliar API inside an

IPython/Jupyter notebook.
