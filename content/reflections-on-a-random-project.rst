Project: netflix/Aminator

Notes:

* NullHandler for logs.
* info() on entrance and exit, debug for the innards.
* use of __all__ = () for __init__.py
* setup.cfg and pbr from Openstack.
* Docstrings used, and occasional comments in code, including TODO
* Sphinx for docs, with its own Makefile.
* Uses abstract base class
* Long coe lines, but not too long.
